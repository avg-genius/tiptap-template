# Tiptap templates

This repository provides exemplary UI templates for those looking to get a headstart with the Tiptap Editor in a React environmentâ€¦ Who said headless can't be helpful?
With these templates, you can quickly bootstrap your project with a well-designed, functional user interface for your Tiptap Editor.

## How to use templates

Clone the repository and copy the template you want to use manually. For a list of all available templates see below.

> [!Important]
> If you do not have access to Tiptap's paid [Content AI](https://tiptap.dev/product/content-ai) features, you will need to remove or exclude the Content AI extension from this template. For your convenience, we have prepared the `free-version` branch that is already configured without the paid extension. This template is designed to showcase UI possibilities and should be adapted to fit your project's requirements and access to [Tiptap features](https://tiptap.dev/pricing).
